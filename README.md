# 📧 Email Classification using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to build a basic machine learning pipeline to classify emails (e.g., spam or ham) using Python and Scikit-learn. It includes a Jupyter Notebook (`email.ipynb`), a dataset (`emails.csv`), and a Python virtual environment (`venv/`) for dependency management.

## 🧠 Features

- Load and clean email data
- Preprocess text (tokenization, stopword removal)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer
- Train ML models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Evaluate model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score
- Visualize results (e.g., confusion matrix)
